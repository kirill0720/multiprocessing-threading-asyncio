# Threading and Multiprocessing Basics

This repository contains examples of threading and multiprocessing in Python. 
These techniques can be used to improve the performance of programs that perform CPU-intensive or I/O-bound tasks.

Please note that the files are organized in order of increasing complexity, 
and it is recommended that you start with the code samples before moving on to the real programs.

## Real Programs

The repository contains several files with real programs that demonstrate the use of 
threading and multiprocessing in Python. These files are:

- s04: Replacing text in files with threading
- s05: Getting stock prices from Yahoo Finance with threading
- s09: Downloading an image from a given URL with threading
- s12: Creating a thumbnail of an image with multiprocessing

## Contributing

If you find a bug or have an idea for a new example, 
please open an issue or a pull request.
